# Solving Inventory Inefficiencies Using Advanced SQL Analytics

## Introduction

Urban Retail Co. is a rapidly expanding mid-sized retail chain with both physical stores and online platforms. With operations across multiple cities and a product catalog of over 5,000 SKUs, the company struggles with maintaining optimal inventory levels due to operational complexity.

Despite having access to sales, product, and warehouse data, inventory inefficiencies persist due to underutilized data and reactive, manual processes.

## The Challenge

Current issues include:

- **Frequent stockouts** of fast-moving products, leading to missed sales and poor customer satisfaction.
- **Overstocking** of slow-moving items, tying up capital and increasing warehousing costs.
- **Lack of real-time insights** into SKU performance, reorder thresholds, and supplier reliability.
- **Poor visibility** across product categories, store locations, and regions.

## Your Mission

As aspiring data analysts, your goal is to **design and implement a SQL-driven inventory monitoring and optimization solution** simulating a real-world retail analytics role.

### You are expected to:

- Create efficient and scalable SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze inventory and sales data.
- Diagnose inefficiencies, recommend actions, and forecast inventory needs using historical data.
- Deliver both technical outputs (SQL scripts, schema designs) and actionable business insights.

## Key Tasks and Deliverables

### SQL Queries

Develop queries to:

- Calculate stock levels across stores and warehouses.
- Detect low inventory using reorder points.
- Estimate reorder points using historical trends.
- Analyze inventory turnover.
- Generate summary reports with KPIs (stockout rates, inventory age, average stock levels).

### Database Optimization

- Normalize raw inventory datasets into a relational schema.
- Apply best practices: indexing, joins, window functions, etc.

### Analytical Outputs

- Identify fast-selling vs. slow-moving products.
- Recommend stock adjustments to reduce holding costs.
- Highlight supplier performance issues.
- Forecast demand trends using seasonal/cyclical data.

## What We Expect From You

- **Technical:** Clean, optimized, and well-documented SQL code.
- **Analytical Thinking:** Turn data into insights that solve business problems.
- **Communication:** Clear presentation of findings, rationale, and business impact.
- **Creativity:** Suggest additional queries or visualizations beyond the brief.

## Expected Business Impact

By completing the project, your solution should help Urban Retail Co.:

- Make smarter inventory decisions using data.
- Reduce stockouts and overstocking.
- Improve supply chain efficiency.
- Enhance customer satisfaction and profitability.

## Final Submission Should Include

- SQL scripts with documentation.
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) or schema design.
- Inventory KPI dashboard or report.
- A brief executive summary (1â€“2 pages) outlining insights and recommendations.
